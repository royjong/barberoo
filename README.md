### barberoo - Appointment System API

Barberoo is a basic open source RestfulAPI  made in  Nodejs + JWT.
I made this project because I hate calling the barber for an appointment and I'd much rather just make a appointment on the internet . 


### ENDPOINTS FOR THE API

[*] GET /api/v2/appointment/:barberID/
This endpoint will return all appointments for a specific barber.

This endpoint will return a specific appointment for the given barber.
